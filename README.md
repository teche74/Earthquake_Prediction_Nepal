# Earthquake_Prediction_Nepal
This project aims to predict severe earthquake damage in Nepal using logistic regression and decision trees. By analyzing factors such as building condition, foundation type, roof type, and other attributes, the models classify whether the damage is severe (1) or not severe (0).
